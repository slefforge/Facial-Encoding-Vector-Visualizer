This document is for speculation about what each of the components of the 128 dimensional vector are encoding.
I've been putting what I believe the higher value represents first followed by what I believe the lower value represents in parentheis.
Ideally there would be an elegant way to write all of these (i.e. "eye size") where it's clear what the value means without any need
for an orgazational standard, but many of these components don't seem so cut and dry.
